                    <p>How to Perform <b>Squats</b>: A Step-by-Step Guide</p><p>
                    Introduction:</p>
                    <p>Squats are a fundamental compound exercise that engages multiple muscle groups, 
                    primarily focusing on the lower body. Proper form is crucial to maximize effectiveness and prevent injury. 
                    Here's a guide to performing squats correctly:</p>
                    1. Maintain a Neutral Spine: Keep your back straight throughout the movement to prevent stress on the spine.
                    <p>2. Knee Alignment: Ensure your knees track in line with your toes to prevent undue stress on the joints.</p>
                    <p>3. Depth: Aim for at least parallel thigh position to engage muscles fully, but don't compromise form for depth.</p>

                    Follow these steps to perform side lunges with proper form:</p>
                    1. Full Range of Motion: Lift your heels as high as possible and lower them down completely to ensure a full range of motion.
                    <p>2. Steady Pace: Perform the calf raises at a controlled pace, avoiding quick or jerky movements.</p>
                    <p>3. Foot Position: Experiment with different foot positions, such as toes pointed forward and toes turned slightly outward, to target different parts of the calf muscles.</p>

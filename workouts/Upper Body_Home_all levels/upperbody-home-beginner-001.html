                    <p>How to Perform <b>Chest flies</b>: A Step-by-Step Guide</p><p>
                    Introduction:</p>
                    <p>Chest flies are an isolation exercise that targets the pectoral muscles. 
                    This movement is commonly performed using dumbbells, cables, or machines, and it's effective for building strength and definition in the chest.
                    Follow these steps to perform Chest flies with proper form:</p>
                    1. Maintain a Neutral Spine: Keep your back flat against the bench and avoid arching or lifting your lower back.
                    <p>2. Control the Weights: Focus on controlling the descent and ascent of the weights to maximize muscle engagement.</p>
                    <p>3. Avoid Locking Your Elbows: Keep a soft bend in your elbows to protect your joints.</p>
                    <p>4. Choose Appropriate Weight: Start with a weight that challenges you without compromising form.</p>

                    <p>How to Perform <b>Pull-Ups</b>: A Step-by-Step Guide</p><p>
                    Introduction:</p>
                    <p>Pull-Ups are a compound exercise that primarily targets the muscles of the upper back, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and biceps. 
                    This exercise also engages the muscles of the core and arms.
                    Tips for Proper Form:</p>
                    1. Grip Placement: Adjust your grip width based on comfort and goals, wider grips target different muscles.
                    <p>2. Elbow Position: Keep your elbows pointing down and slightly back, not flaring outward.</p>
                    <p>3. Full Range of Motion: Aim for a full range of motion, bringing your chin above the bar during each repetition.</p>
                    <p>4. Avoid Swinging: Minimize swinging or kipping motions; use strict form for better muscle engagement.</p>

                    <p>How to Perform <b>Reverse Flys</b>: A Step-by-Step Guide</p><p>
                    Introduction:</p>
                    <p>Reverse Flys are an effective exercise for targeting the muscles of the upper back, particularly the rear deltoids and rhomboids. 
                    This exercise helps improve posture and strengthens the muscles responsible for scapular retraction.
                    Follow these steps to perform Reverse Flys with proper form:</p>
                    1. Maintain Stable Posture: Keep your body stable and avoid excessive swinging or body movement.
                    <p>2. Slight Bend in Elbows: Maintain a slight bend in your elbows throughout the movement to protect your joints.</p>
                    <p>3. Focus on Rear Delts and Rhomboids: Emphasize the contraction in the rear deltoids and rhomboids during the fly.</p>
                    <p>4. Breathing: Inhale during the opening of the arms, and exhale during the return to the starting position.</p>

                <p>How to Perform <b>Bicep Curls</b>: A Step-by-Step Guide</p><p>
                Introduction:</p>
                <p>Bicep Curls using a machine are an isolation exercise that targets the biceps. 
                This machine provides stability and helps isolate the biceps for effective strength and muscle development.
                Follow these steps to perform Bicep curls with proper form:</p>
                1. Stable Position: Ensure your back is firmly against the pad, and your upper arms remain stationary.
                <p>2. Full Range of Motion: Allow your forearms to fully extend at the bottom and flex completely at the top.</p>
                <p>3. Smooth Movements: Avoid using momentum; perform the exercise with controlled and deliberate movements.</p>

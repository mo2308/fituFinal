                    This exercise is performed by placing your hands wider than shoulder-width apart.
                    Follow these steps to perform Wide Push-Ups with proper form:</p>
                    1. Hand and Wrist Alignment: Align your hands with your wrists to prevent unnecessary stress on the joints.
                    <p>2. Maintain Core Engagement: Keep your core muscles engaged throughout the exercise for stability.</p>
                    <p>3. Breathing: Inhale as you lower your body, and exhale as you push back up.</p>
                    <p>4. Full Range of Motion: Aim for a full range of motion to maximize muscle engagement.</p>

                    <b>Please note:</b><p>The choice of rep range influences the physiological adaptations in your muscles. 
                        Lower reps with heavier weights stimulate muscle fibers to become stronger and more efficient at producing force. 
                        Higher reps with moderate weights, on the other hand, enhance endurance and contribute to muscle definition.</p>
                        <p>It's important to note that these rep ranges aren't strict rules but general guidelines. 
                        Individual factors such as your fitness level, preferences, and overall workout structure can influence the ideal rep range for you. 
                        Additionally, incorporating variety into your workout routine, including different rep ranges and squat variations, can contribute to a well-rounded and effective training program.</p>

            <b>Please note:</b><p>The choice of rep range and the amount of weight influences the physiological adaptations in your muscles. 
                Lower reps with heavier weights stimulate muscle fibers to become stronger and more efficient at producing force. 
                Higher reps with moderate weights, on the other hand, enhance endurance and contribute to muscle definition.</p>
                <p>It's important to note that these rep ranges aren't strict rules but general guidelines. 
                Individual factors such as your fitness level, preferences, and overall workout structure can influence the ideal rep range for you. 
                Additionally, incorporating variety into your workout routine, including different rep ranges and squat variations, can contribute to a well-rounded and effective training program.</p>

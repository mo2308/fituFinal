                    <p>How to Perform <b>Supermans</b>: A Step-by-Step Guide</p><p>
                    Introduction:</p>
                    <p>Supermans are an effective bodyweight exercise that targets the muscles in the lower back, glutes, and upper back. 
                    This exercise is excellent for strengthening the posterior chain and improving spinal stability.
                    Tips for Proper Form:</p>
                    1. Engage Core Muscles: Keep your core engaged throughout the movement to protect your lower back.
                    <p>2. Avoid Hyperextension: Lift your limbs to a comfortable height, avoiding excessive hyperextension.</p>
                    <p>3. Focus on the Back Muscles: Emphasize the contraction of the muscles in your back, rather than relying solely on momentum.</p>
                    <p>Breathe Naturally: Inhale as you lift, hold, and exhale as you lower back down.</p>

                    <p>3. Focus on Rear Delts: Emphasize the contraction in the rear deltoids by pulling towards the sides of your face.</p>
                    <p>4. Breathing: Inhale during the pull, and exhale during the release.</p>

                    <b>Please note:</b><p>The choice of rep range influences the physiological adaptations in your muscles. 
                        Lower reps with heavier weights stimulate muscle fibers to become stronger and more efficient at producing force. 
                        Higher reps with moderate weights, on the other hand, enhance endurance and contribute to muscle definition.</p>
                        <p>It's important to note that these rep ranges aren't strict rules but general guidelines. 
                        Individual factors such as your fitness level, preferences, and overall workout structure can influence the ideal rep range for you. 
                        Additionally, incorporating variety into your workout routine, including different rep ranges and squat variations, can contribute to a well-rounded and effective training program.</p>

                    <p>How to Perform <b>Reverse Flys</b>: A Step-by-Step Guide</p><p>
                    Introduction:</p>
                    <p>Reverse Flys are an effective exercise for targeting the muscles of the upper back, particularly the rear deltoids and rhomboids. 
                    This exercise helps improve posture and strengthens the muscles responsible for scapular retraction.
                    Follow these steps to perform Reverse Flys with proper form:</p>
                    1. Maintain Stable Posture: Keep your body stable and avoid excessive swinging or body movement.
                    <p>2. Slight Bend in Elbows: Maintain a slight bend in your elbows throughout the movement to protect your joints.</p>
                    <p>3. Focus on Rear Delts and Rhomboids: Emphasize the contraction in the rear deltoids and rhomboids during the fly.</p>
                    <p>4. Breathing: Inhale during the opening of the arms, and exhale during the return to the starting position.</p>

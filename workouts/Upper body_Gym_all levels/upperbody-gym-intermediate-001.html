                    <p>How to Perform <b>Lateral raises</b>: A Step-by-Step Guide</p><p>
                    Introduction:</p>
                    <p>Lateral raises are an isolation exercise that targets the lateral deltoids, helping to build width and definition in the shoulders. 
                    This exercise is commonly done with dumbbells.
                    Follow these steps to perform Lateral raises with proper form:</p>
                    1. Avoid Excessive Weight: Use a weight that challenges your shoulders without compromising form.
                    <p>2. Maintain a Slight Bend: Keep a slight bend in your elbows throughout the movement.</p>
                    <p>3. Focus on the Lateral Deltoids: Emphasize the use of your lateral deltoids to lift the weights.</p>
                    <p>4. Full Range of Motion: Aim for a full range of motion, lifting the dumbbells to shoulder height.</p>

                    Introduction:</p>
                    <p>Mountain climbers are a dynamic, full-body exercise that engages multiple muscle groups, including the core, shoulders, arms, and legs. 
                    This exercise also provides cardiovascular benefits, making it an excellent addition to high-intensity workouts.
                    Follow these steps to perform side lunges with proper form:</p>
                    1. Maintain Proper Plank Position: Ensure your body remains in a straight line from head to heels.
                    <p>2. Avoid Rapid Hip Movement: Minimize unnecessary movement in your hips by stabilizing your core.</p>
                    <p>3. Land Softly: Bring your knees toward your chest in a controlled manner, landing softly on the balls of your feet.</p>
